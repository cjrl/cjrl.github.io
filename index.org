** About Me

   I am a Mathematician at the [[https://www.faa.gov/][Federal Aviation Administration]].
   
   I graduated with my Mathematics Ph.D. from the University of Virginia
   in Spring 2021. There, I studied homotopy theory under the
   direction of [[https://uva.theopenscholar.com/nick-kuhn][Professor Nicholas Kuhn]]. In particular, my research
   concerned the structure of the equivariant stable homotopy Balmer
   spectrum and its applications to non-equivariant settings. My
   dissertation is titled [[https://doi.org/10.18130/3h64-wv15][Applications of Chromatic Fixed Point
   Theory.]]
   
   Before coming to the University of Virginia I received my B.S. in
   mathematics with a minor in computer science at the University of Mary
   Washington, where I was mentored by
   [[https://doctorh.umwblogs.org/about/][Professor Randall D. Helmstutler]] and
   [[http://marshallandrew.net/#home][Professor Andrew Marshall]].
   
   Outside of mathematics, I enjoy the outdoors, and programming.

** Engagement 
*** Career Panels
   - 03/01/2024 - UVA Graduate Seminar - Transitioning from Academia to Industry
   - 06/29/2023 - Jepson Summer Science - Academia and Industry Panel
   - 03/20/2019 - UMW Math Department Career Night - Applying to Math
     Grad School

*** Directed Reading Program
    Starting in Fall 2018 I have worked closely with [[https://sites.google.com/view/sara-maloni][Professor Sara Maloni]]
    to organize the University of Virginia chapter of the [[https://math.virginia.edu/drp/][Directed
    Reading Program]]. This program pairs advanced undergraduates with
    graduate student mentors to explore an area of math not typically
    covered in the undergraduate curriculum. This program is very
    important to me which is why I have taken on the following roles:
    - Graduate committee chair
    - Webmaster 
    - Mentor
     
*** Research Experience for Undergraduates 
    
    In the Summer of 2020 I participated as a mentor in the University
    of Virginia Topology and Geometry REU. I worked under the
    direction of [[https://sites.google.com/view/julie-bergner/][Professor Julie Bergner]] with fellow graduate student
    [[https://sites.google.com/view/rossakhmechet][Ross Akhmechet]] to assist the undergraduate researchers as they
    explored the feasibility of a TQFT theory for embedded
    cobordisms that could detect knottings. 
    
*** Teaching Mentor 
    As a 5th year graduate student I have had the opportunity to teach
    a variety of classes at the university level, however not so many
    that I no longer remember what it was like to be a first time
    instructor. For this reason I was very pleased to accept the
    invitation from [[https://uva.theopenscholar.com/paul-bourdon][Professor Paul Bourdon]] to be a teaching mentor for
    a second year graduate student in Fall 2020.

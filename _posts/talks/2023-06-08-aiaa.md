The Air Traffic Organization within the Federal Aviation Administration is focused on improving the pre-tactical planning phase of air traffic flow management. The Advanced Planning team at the Air Traffic Control System Command Center is responsible for planning operations for the following day. The purpose of this research is to analyze the feasibility of operationalizing machine learning to identify potential demand-capacity imbalances for use by the Advanced Planning Team. Random Forest models are trained for each of the CONUS Core 30 airports to predict both runway configurations and rates. The accuracy of these models is assessed with the time-series walk-forward validation method. The preliminary results are encouraging. The speed at which these models can be retrained and their associated accuracies are sufficient for phase-based trial implementation at specific airports to determine operational feasibility. However, the efficacy of the machine learning models varies by airport and more research is needed to improve the low performing models.
